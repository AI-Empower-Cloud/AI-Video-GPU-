# üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Your AI GPU Platform Deployment

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ First: Add GitHub Authentication Secret

I've created the Azure service principal credentials for GitHub Actions. To fix the failing workflows, you need to add these credentials to your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/AI-Empower-Cloud/AI-Video-GPU-
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Select **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**
5. Enter the following:
   - **Name**: `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
   - **Value**: Copy and paste the entire contents of the `github-azure-credentials.json` file

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Second: Re-run GitHub Workflow

After adding the secret:

1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on the failed **Deploy to Azure** workflow
3. Click **Re-run jobs** ‚Üí **Re-run all jobs**

This will start the deployment with proper authentication.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Third: Request GPU Quota

While the CPU deployment is running:

1. Go to Azure Portal: https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Capacity/QuotaMenuBlade/~/compute
2. Follow instructions in `azure_gpu_quota_request_guide.md`:
   - Request standardNCFamily quota increase to 6 cores
   - Location: East US
   - Justification text is in the guide

## üîÑ Monitoring Deployment

Your deployment status is visible in GitHub Actions. When complete:

- Frontend: `https://ai-gpu-studio.azurewebsites.net`
- Backend API: `https://ai-gpu-studio-api.azurewebsites.net`

## üì± Access After Deployment

You'll be able to access your AI Video Platform:

- Web interface will be deployed to Azure Static Web Apps
- API endpoints to Azure App Service
- Database to Azure SQL
- File storage to Azure Blob Storage

## üîÑ Upgrading to GPU Later

When your GPU quota request is approved (typically 3-5 days):

1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Run the workflow manually with:
   - Environment: `production`
   - GPU support: `true`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter issues:

1. **Deployment fails**: Check workflow logs for detailed error messages
2. **Resource creation fails**: May need to change resource names in `.github/workflows/azure-deploy.yml`
3. **Timeout issues**: Large deployments may need multiple attempts

## üìã What's Next After Deployment?

1. Complete AWS Activate form with the guide (`AWS_ACTIVATE_FORM_GUIDE.md`)
2. Set up Google Cloud credits ($20K+)
3. Configure multi-cloud deployment
4. Enhance platform features
