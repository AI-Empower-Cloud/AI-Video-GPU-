```
AI Empower GPU Cloud is developing an affordable GPU cloud platform to democratize AI/ML compute access for developers and researchers. We're creating cost-effective GPU instances for machine learning training, AI model inference, and scientific computing workloads through innovative resource optimization and community-focused pricing.
```

### AWS Credits Usage Plan (Detailed)
```
Development and deployment of AI GPU Cloud Platform:

1. MVP Development (40%):
   - EC2 GPU instances (p3, g4 families) for platform testing
   - Development and staging environments
   - Load testing infrastructure

2. Production Infrastructure (35%):
   - Multi-AZ GPU instance deployment
   - Auto-scaling groups for resource optimization
   - Load balancing and networking setup

3. Data & Storage (25%):
   - S3 for ML model repositories and datasets
   - RDS for user management and billing data
   - CloudFront for global content delivery

This infrastructure will enable us to prove market fit, onboard beta users, and demonstrate technical viability before seeking additional funding.
```

### Monthly Usage Breakdown
```
Projected monthly usage:
- Compute: $1,500-3,000 (GPU instances, web services)
- Storage: $200-500 (S3, EBS volumes)
- Networking: $100-300 (data transfer, load balancing)
- Database: $100-200 (RDS instances)
- Total: $1,900-4,000/month growing to $10,000+/month as we scale
```
