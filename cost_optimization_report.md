## Cost Comparison
| Provider | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Savings vs Cheapest |
|----------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Azure    | $728.89 | $8746.67 | 24.1% more |
| AWS      | $719.19 | $8630.24 | 22.5% more |
| GCP      | $587.20 | $7046.40 | 0% (Cheapest) |

## ðŸŽ¯ Optimization Strategies

### 1. Multi-Cloud Strategy
**Recommendation**: Use different clouds for different workloads
- **GCP**: GPU-intensive video processing (cheapest GPU compute)
- **Azure**: Web services and APIs (good balance)
- **AWS**: Storage and CDN (competitive bandwidth pricing)

**Potential Savings**: 15-30% compared to single-cloud

### 2. Spot/Preemptible Instances
- **Azure Spot**: Up to 90% savings on compute
- **AWS Spot**: Up to 90% savings on EC2
- **GCP Preemptible**: Up to 80% savings on compute

**Estimated Savings**: $176.16/month

### 3. Reserved Instances
- **1-year commitment**: 20-40% savings
- **3-year commitment**: 30-60% savings

**Estimated Savings**: $205.52/month

### 4. Auto-Scaling
- **Scale down during low usage**: 40-60% savings
- **Weekend/night shutdown**: Additional 30% savings

**Estimated Savings**: $264.24/month

### 5. Storage Optimization
- **Use cheaper storage tiers** for inactive data
- **Compress video files** to reduce storage needs
- **Implement lifecycle policies** for automatic tier transitions

**Estimated Savings**: $58.72/month

## ðŸ“Š Recommended Multi-Cloud Setup

### Primary Workload Distribution
1. **GCP (40%)**: Video processing, AI/ML workloads
   - Cost: $234.88/month
   - Reason: Cheapest GPU compute

2. **Azure (35%)**: Web services, APIs, databases
   - Cost: $255.11/month
   - Reason: Balanced pricing, existing setup

3. **AWS (25%)**: Storage, CDN, backup
   - Cost: $179.80/month
   - Reason: Competitive storage and bandwidth

**Total Multi-Cloud Cost**: $669.79/month

## ðŸŽ¯ Action Items
1. **Immediate (This Week)**:
   - Set up GCP account with GPU quota
   - Configure spot instances where possible
   - Implement auto-scaling policies

2. **Short-term (Next Month)**:
   - Migrate video processing to GCP
   - Set up cross-cloud backup
   - Purchase reserved instances for stable workloads

3. **Long-term (Next Quarter)**:
   - Implement full multi-cloud orchestration
   - Set up cost monitoring and alerts
   - Optimize based on usage patterns

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Tips
- Monitor costs daily with cloud billing APIs
- Use cloud cost calculators for planning
- Implement budget alerts at 80% of monthly limit
- Review and optimize monthly
